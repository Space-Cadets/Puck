Students will develop a deep understanding of the various legal, regulatory, compliance, and business issues facing amateur athletics, and propose well-articulated solutions and reforms to those problems. In particular, students will be asked to analyze the current state of intercollegiate athletics in the United States, evaluate the numerous shifts that are taking place in that landscape, and craft recommendations regarding the future operating model of college sports.","enrolled":23,"instructors":["Vincent P.

Through the understanding of their roles and responsibilities, students learn about Comprehensive Soldier Fitness (CSF), being ready and resilient (R2C) and Individual and Family Readiness can assist them in preparing their Soldiers and their families on reducing and managing stress during times of uncertainty. The course places significant emphasis on preparing students for BOLC B and their first unit of assignment. It uses mission command case studies and scenarios to prepare them to face the complex ethical demands of serving as a commissioned officer in the United States Army. This semester, students: Identify the leader's roles and responsibilities for enforcing Army policies and programs; Explore the dynamics of building a team prepared to handle any future operational environment and win; Examine the importance of understanding culture and how it can affect their unit and mission; Develop both oral and written communication skills by conducting a battle analysis and decision briefs.","enrolled":9,"instructors":["Michael J.

The course places significant emphasis on preparing students for BOLC B and their first unit of assignment. It uses mission command case studies and scenarios to prepare them to face the complex ethical demands of serving as a commissioned officer in the United States Army. This semester, students: Identify the leader's roles and responsibilities for enforcing Army policies and programs; Explore the dynamics of building a team prepared to handle any future operational environment and win; Examine the importance of understanding culture and how it can affect their unit and mission; Develop both oral and written communication skills by conducting a battle analysis and decision briefs.","enrolled":0,"instructors":["Michael J.
